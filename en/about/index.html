    <h1><span data-i18n="skills.my_skills">Why do I write?</span></h1>

    <div>
        <p>
            Actually, I'm trying to write. Social media and blogging are probably among the topics I'm least successful at. I'm trying to keep experimenting :)
        </p>

        <p>
            I plan to share my views, ideas, self-discussions, and brainstorming on various topics, especially the components of the training methodology I've developed. I'll try to do alchemy in a counterclockwise direction.

    <h1><span data-i18n="skills.my_skills">About Me</span></h1>

    <div>
      
        <p>
            With over 16 years of experience in cybersecurity, I began my professional career with cryptanalysis of image encryption in chaotic systems.
        </p>

        <p>
            After working on topics such as offensive security and penetration testing at various companies, I served as an incident management specialist in multinational companies. From this perspective, I have experience on both the offensive and defensive sides.
        </p>
        <p>
            I contributed as a technical reviewer to 5 different internationally published books. I am an interdisciplinary cybersecurity expert interested in the reflections of different disciplines in the cyber world, including terrorism and intelligence studies, psychological operations, and war studies.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to technical certifications, I hold a Master's degree in International Relations and Terrorism, as well as various certifications related to terrorism and international security studies. On the physical security side, I have certifications in various areas of security, such as advanced tactical shooting, operational tactical shooting, dynamic carbine, tactical casualty care, and survival in extreme conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
            I participated as an assistant trainer and interrogation expert in a reality show called Semender, which was broadcast on TRT Documentary channel. I taught cryptology and system security courses at Marmara University Faculty of Engineering.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am currently conducting interdisciplinary cybersecurity research at Cyber Struggle and teaching an interdisciplinary and original course called Cyber Warfare at Kadir Has University as part of CyberMACs, a joint master's program under the European Union.
