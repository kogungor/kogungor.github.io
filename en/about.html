<h1>About</h1>

<p>
  With over 16 years of experience in cybersecurity, I began my professional career with cryptanalysis of image encryption in chaotic systems.
</p>

<p>
  After working on offensive security and penetration testing at various companies, I served as an incident management specialist at multinational corporations. This gave me experience on both the offensive and defensive sides.
</p>

<p>
  I've contributed as a technical reviewer to 5 internationally published books. I'm an interdisciplinary cybersecurity expert interested in the reflections of different disciplines in the cyber world, including terrorism and intelligence studies, psychological operations, and war studies.
</p>

<p>
  In addition to technical certifications, I hold a Master's degree in International Relations and Terrorism, as well as various certifications related to terrorism and international security studies. On the physical security side, I have certifications in advanced tactical shooting, operational tactical shooting, dynamic carbine, tactical casualty care, and survival in extreme conditions.

<p>
  I appeared as an assistant trainer and interrogation specialist in a reality show called Semender, broadcast on TRT Documentary channel. I've taught cryptology and system security courses at Marmara University Faculty of Engineering.
</p>

<p>
  Currently, I'm conducting interdisciplinary cybersecurity research at Cyber Struggle and teaching an interdisciplinary and original course called Cyber War at Kadir Has University as part of the CyberMACs program, a joint master's program under the European Union.
