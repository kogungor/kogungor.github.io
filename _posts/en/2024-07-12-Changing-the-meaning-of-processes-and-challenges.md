In what situations and on which topics are we told that we are good? Or on which topics is it expressed that we are weak? Why are we good at the subjects we’re told we’re good at? Is it an innate gift? Or did we put in a lot of effort to become good at it? Are we bad because we tried before and failed? Or because we’ve never tried? Or is it because we’ve tried repeatedly and failed each time?

Messages about being good or bad at something may come from within us as much as from external sources. Especially since they contain words like “being”, these messages at some point become directly related to the identity through which we conduct our relationship with life.

<h2>
The Importance of Feedback Style
</h2>

Perhaps it makes sense in this respect that identity-related feedback leads to more reflexes. For example, when giving feedback to someone, using expressions like ‘intelligent,’ ‘smart,’ ‘talented,’ or ‘very knowledgeable’ directly ties into their identity. Such feedback places a burden on the individual. Since we associate the person’s existence with this feedback, situations that contradict these messages can trigger reflexes related to their being.

Feedback can also be given focusing on effort rather than identity and existence. For example, highlighting hard work, perseverance despite everything, attitudes displayed in the face of challenges, and focusing on the process.

Regardless of the type, this feedback is entirely intertwined with our fundamental beliefs about what we can achieve.

Carol Dweck and Claudia Mueller initiated an experimental study to research these two different approaches on children. In the study, one group of children received feedback directly associated with their identity, while another group received feedback emphasizing effort and process. Lastly, a control group received no feedback at all. The results of this study conducted with over 100 children are quite interesting!

When children were given the freedom to choose problems, it was observed that those who received identity-focused feedback tended to solve only problems in areas where they were already good. Thoughts like wanting to continue being praised and not feeling an existential threat added extra anxiety.

Moreover, it was seen that children who received identity-focused feedback wanted to face fewer problems, not just in terms of difficulty level but also numerically. It might also be considered as a reflex of protecting the current posture of the identity.

On the other hand, children who received effort and process-focused feedback were found to choose more challenging problems.

Cognitive ability tests were also administered to these groups, and in the initial tests, all groups received similar results. However, a significant decrease was observed in the test scores of students who were praised based on identity before the second test. In contrast, a noticeable increase was seen in the second test scores of students who received effort-focused praise.

Even more interestingly, when these students were asked to explain their performance to others, it was found that the group praised based on identity had a much higher tendency to hide and lie due to similar anxieties.


<h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>

We said feedback is important because, as Heidegger tried to explain with the concept of “Dasein,” we are in constant interaction with the world. The process of becoming something shapes through the meaning relationships and interactions we establish with the world.

Neurons in the brain communicate via electrical and chemical signals. Dendrites transmit incoming signals to the nucleus; the nucleus gathers these signals and sends them to the axon; finally, the axon processes these signals and sends them to synapses. Synapses then transmit signals to other nerve cells. Normally, the transmission speed in neurons is about 50 centimeters per second, but in neurons where the axons are surrounded and protected by a myelin sheath, this transmission speed can be up to 240 times faster.

It was once thought that the number of brain cells was fixed and unchangeable. In the 1900s, neuroscientist Cajal first believed that the brain could develop even in adulthood. In the 1960s, it was shown that neurons could reorganize and become functional again after traumas. It was also demonstrated that stress could change not only the functionality of the brain but also its structure.

As a result of all these studies, it was seen that the brain’s cells could die, form new connections, and even renew themselves through other means.

In a study conducted on twin mice raised in different cages, it was observed that the mouse living in a cage with rich experiences was smarter, physically healthier, and, moreover, had a bigger and heavier brain when examined.

Consistent use of the same neural pathways also contributes to the myelination process.

Thus, neuroplasticity refers to the physical changes occurring in the brain because of our interactions with our environment. This affects a wide range of functions, from the brain’s adaptation to changing conditions to our learning of new things.

Think of the brain not only receiving software updates but also hardware upgrades


<h2>
The Power of Yet!
</h2>

Mindset, in general terms, can be said to be our life philosophy, stance, and perspective. Carol Dweck divides mindset into two different categories: fixed mindset and growth mindset.

A fixed mindset is a success-oriented approach built with identity-based feedback, focusing on social status, constructed on limits, and avoiding mistakes to the maximum to protect what one has.

In contrast, a growth mindset rewards efforts, accepts the reality of neuroplasticity, and believes that by adapting and putting in effort, one can develop and always become better.

In this effort-focused process, Carol Dweck talks about the importance of using the power of ‘yet’ instead of the tyranny of ‘now.’ Saying ‘not yet’ instead of ‘I can’t’ shows perseverance. It emphasizes an attitude and a path. Even this simple change in attitude starts to trigger neuroplastic development.

In experiments conducted, especially on individuals with a fixed mindset, interesting results have been obtained:

* They have a higher tendency to cheat instead of working.
* They look for people worse off than themselves in their environment to feel better.
* They tend to escape when faced with difficulties.

Scientists also measured the brain activities of people who faced difficulties and observed significant differences in electrical activity between those with a fixed mindset and those with a growth mindset.



<h2>
Changing the Meaning of Effort and Challenges
</h2>

In the United States, some schools formed pilot classes focused on the growth mindset. Schools in regions where failure was seen as destiny were particularly chosen. Students were instilled with the belief that traits like intelligence and talent are not fixed and permanent, and that success does not depend solely on these. Feedback and praise were directed directly toward effort, development, perseverance, choosing to cope with difficulties, and adaptation efforts. This guidance was also made in the relationships students established with themselves.

At the end of this long-term study:

* In the selected school in Harlem, New York, achievement scores rose to 95%.
* In South Bronx, New York, fourth graders were significantly behind. By the end of the study, these classes had become one of the best in New York on the math test.
* The Native American Reservation rose to the top level in its region within a year.

No matter what subject we’re dealing with, we’re essentially solving problems at the end of the day. Our stance toward problems, the meaning we assign to them, and the attitude we show are the clearest forms of our relationship with problems. Small changes made in this relationship can trigger not only functional but also physical changes in the brain (neuroplasticity).

So much so that today, neuroplasticity is also used in treating some diseases caused by demyelination by further triggering the myelination process. The most well-known demyelinating condition is Multiple Sclerosis (MS). However, it’s known that some of the following diseases are also associated with myelin:

* Depression
* Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
* Bipolar Disorder
* Dyslexia
* Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)
* Cognitive Decline
* Schizophrenia
* Autism

Efforts are being made to protect and renew myelin in controlling and treating these diseases. For example, one reason for applying a ketogenic diet to MS patients is to protect and increase myelin. In some studies, it has been observed that increasing ketone production helps increase myelin production.

<h2>Cyber Struggle Ranger Program and the Growth Mindset</h2>

The first goal of the Ranger Program is to extract the fixed mental schema of the personnel participating in the program. It’s not enough for only the instructors and the system to extract this schema. We also try to support participants in revealing this schema themselves throughout the experience in the program.

After this stage, we focus on making them aware that these schemas are fixed and identity-bound. This process begins by pushing participants toward their early-stage limits. Although we’re talking about a methodological necessity, this is one of the elements that turns the Ranger Program into a different experience even for those who experience it twice in a row. The system strives to confront each participant with the fixed mindset through their own experience. This means a separate roadmap and a unique experience for each person.

Some may think they’re good, some may think they’re smart, and some may think they’re chronically unsuccessful. What’s important here is not that these thoughts are related to identity and contain positive or negative emotions. Our goal is to shift the participant’s focus from the concept of “competence” to the “power of yet.”

In addition to this awareness, participants are expected to adapt to changing situations created throughout the Ranger Program. Every changing situation -unless prior joint planning was done- brings uncertainty and stress. This high adaptation expectation triggers a neuroplasticity process in addition to the focus shift. At least, we expect it to trigger.

While these two issues are experienced in parallel, with the dosage adjusted by the instructors throughout the program, participants are sometimes made to feel that they’re very good at certain subjects, and sometimes that they’re very bad. These feelings and thoughts are constantly altered at appropriate dosages on an individual basis. This flow ensures that participants begin to evaluate problems based on effort, challenges, and meanings after a while. Individuals start to detach from identity-focused fixed thoughts. Feedback, rewards, and praise shift to focus on process and effort, instead of identities.

By increasing the intensity of problems, we also increase the number of repetitions (see myelination!). On the other hand, the problems given are mostly presented in a form where participants are not fully familiar with their solutions. Since no level determination is made for the class before the program, there may be people in the class who know the solutions to the relevant problems. In this case, it’s expected that the “knowledgeable” participant detaches from the positive fixed mindset. There are several ways to detach from here. The first is to delve deeper into the subject! Going beyond the answer to the given problem and solving it with a better version of themselves. Another is the team! Staying in the growth mindset within the framework of human-centered skills as part of the stories of other participants in the team. Pulling the team, helping the team, leading the team, carrying the team, you name it!

Of course, here, Jean-Paul Sartre’s saying, “existence precedes essence” and the relationship with freedom comes into play. Sartre says, “Man first exists, then creates his own identity.” This power to determine identity gives freedom to the person. Decisions made with this freedom give meaning to one’s existence.

Sometimes, participants who “know well” prefer the path I mentioned above, staying on their own growth axis while also choosing to be part of others’ stories. However, sometimes they may think the program won’t add anything to them and may leave the program. We’ve experienced all these choices with different participants.

Throughout the Ranger Program, various periodic tasks are given to participants. While some of these tasks aim to trigger neuroplasticity for emotional state control, others aim to trigger neuroplasticity for critical thinking, case formulation, automatic thoughts, intermediate beliefs, the discovery and change of core beliefs, or the development of key cognitive processes.

Experiencing all these in a coordinated way helps move participants from a fixed mindset to a growth mindset. Participants become individuals who regulate their emotions better, develop new behaviors and habits, show less tendency to give up in the face of challenges, are more resilient to uncertainties, see growth opportunities in crises and problems, and have developed problem-solving skills.

So, what’s the importance of all this for cybersecurity training? What’s wrong with explaining common technical problems and how to solve them, formulating solutions, and providing these formulas or cheatheets to participants?

It is possible to address the answer from many different perspectives for Cyber Struggle;

* **Methodological Chronic Perspective:** First, there are hundreds of trainings, many of which are free or nearly free. Yet we’re still talking about the human resource problem, both quantitatively and qualitatively. This means that the problem is more deep-rooted than the number of trainings or their accessibility. Moreover, very few of those who have received such training and reached the stage of practicing the profession are effective in creativity, flexibility, problem-solving, creating high impact, and exceeding expectations.
* **Learning Perspective:** The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. A growth-oriented mindset has a significant impact on learning. Some effects are immediately noticeable, while others may require certain experiences to be recognized.
* Functionality Perspective: The fact that development is achieved through problems and challenges and is effort-focused, along with the belief that human skills are not fixed, automatically keeps the individual function-focused. It goes beyond identity-focused notions like “being good” or “knowing well,” focusing more on solving problems, creating higher impact, and developing further.
* **Giving Meaning to My Own Existence:** The effort and courage to seek and do better.
